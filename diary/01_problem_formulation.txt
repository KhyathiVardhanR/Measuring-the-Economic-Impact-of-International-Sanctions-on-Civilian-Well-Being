Project Title

Assessing the Civilian Impact of International Sanctions on Economic and Social Well-Being


Problem Statement

International sanctions are designed to impose economic costs in order to alter government behavior. However, these costs are frequently transmitted through domestic markets and civilian populations. While traditional analyses emphasize macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment, these measures alone do not fully capture how sanctions affect household welfare and everyday living conditions.

Sanctions can restrict trade, limit access to foreign currency and financial systems, reduce imports of essential goods such as food and medicine, and generate price instability. These disruptions may translate into higher poverty rates, rising inequality, worsening child health outcomes, and broader declines in civilian welfare. In addition, economic stress may coincide with political instability or leadership turnover.

This project evaluates whether international sanctions generate measurable economic and social hardship for civilians, and through which economic transmission mechanisms these effects operate.


Research Question

How do international sanctions affect civilian economic and social well-being over time, through what economic channels do these effects propagate, and do these pressures coincide with political instability?


Defined Inputs (Data)

The project integrates four primary datasets to construct a country-year panel framework:

1. Sanctions Data
- Sanction start and end dates
- Type and scope of sanctions (financial, trade, sectoral, targeted)
- Duration and intensity indicators
Source: Global Sanctions Data Base (GSDB)

2. Trade Data (Transmission Mechanism)
- Food imports
- Medicine imports
- Oil exports
- Fuel imports
Source: UN Comtrade

These variables capture how sanctions affect international trade flows and essential goods availability.

3. Macroeconomic and Social Indicators
- GDP growth
- Inflation rate
- Unemployment rate
- Poverty rate
- Income inequality (Gini index)
- Under-5 child mortality rate
- School enrollment
Source: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)

These indicators measure both national economic performance and household-level well-being.

4. Political and Conflict Indicators
- Armed conflict incidence and intensity
- Regime type and political stability
- Leadership turnover events
Sources: UCDP Armed Conflict Dataset, Polity V, Archigos

These variables help distinguish sanction effects from war-related economic shocks and allow exploration of whether economic hardship coincides with political instability.


Defined Outputs

The project will produce:

- Descriptive time-series analysis of sanctions and civilian outcomes
- Event-study visualizations of pre- and post-sanction dynamics
- Panel regression models with country and year fixed effects
- Mechanism testing through trade-mediated channels
- Comparative analysis of sanction types and intensity
- Exploratory analysis of political instability and leadership turnover


Time Horizon

The analysis covers the period from 2000 to 2023, depending on data availability. This timeframe captures multiple sanction episodes and allows examination of both short-term and medium-term dynamic effects.


Why This Problem Matters

Sanctions are often described as targeted tools aimed at influencing governments. However, economic disruptions may disproportionately affect civilian populations through trade contraction, price instability, and reduced access to essential goods.

By integrating sanctions data with trade flows, macroeconomic indicators, social welfare measures, and political controls within a structured panel framework, this project provides a rigorous and multidimensional assessment of the civilian consequences of international sanctions. The findings aim to contribute to policy debates regarding the humanitarian implications and effectiveness of economic coercion.
