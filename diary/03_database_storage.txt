Data Acquisition II – Database Storage


Overview

To integrate sanctions data with economic, trade, and social indicators, a relational database was implemented using SQLite. Structuring the data in a relational format ensures consistency, efficient querying, and scalable integration of multiple datasets. This database supports the construction of a panel dataset aligned by country and year.


Database Choice

SQLite was selected because it is lightweight, portable, and well-suited for small to medium-sized research datasets. It integrates seamlessly with Python and pandas, allowing automated data cleaning, transformation, and database generation. Its file-based structure also supports full reproducibility and easy sharing.


Database Schema

The database is designed as a country-year panel structure. Each table uses country and year as key attributes to ensure proper alignment across datasets.

The schema includes the following core tables:


1. Sanctions Table

This table stores structured sanctions data. Each record includes:

- Country
- Year
- Sanction start and end indicators
- Sanction type (financial, trade, targeted)
- Severity measures (sector coverage, financial restrictions)
- Aggregated sanction-related event counts (from GDELT)

This allows sanctions to be measured both by intensity and classification.


2. Macroeconomic Indicators Table

This table includes:

- Country
- Year
- GDP growth
- Inflation rate
- Unemployment rate

These indicators capture national-level economic conditions.


3. Trade and Sectoral Table

This table captures transmission mechanisms and includes:

- Country
- Year
- Food imports
- Medicine imports
- Oil exports
- Fuel imports

Tracking trade flows allows identification of how sanctions affect essential goods.


4. Social and Household Indicators Table

This table includes:

- Country
- Year
- Poverty rate
- Income inequality (Gini index)
- Under-5 child mortality
- Nutrition indicators
- Education indicators (if available)

These variables measure civilian well-being beyond macroeconomic averages.


Integration Strategy

All tables share country and year as primary join keys, allowing flexible panel analysis across sanction intensity, economic outcomes, trade shocks, and social indicators.

This structure enables:

- Cross-sectional comparisons between countries
- Before-and-after sanction analysis
- Difference-in-Differences modeling
- Event-study design


Reproducibility

The entire database is generated programmatically using Python scripts included in the repository. The workflow includes:

- Data cleaning and normalization
- Variable standardization
- Automated table creation
- Validation checks

Because the database is built directly from raw public datasets, it can be fully recreated at any time, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
