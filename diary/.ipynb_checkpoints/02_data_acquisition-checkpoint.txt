Data Acquisition – Milestone 1


Overview

This project constructs a multidimensional country-year panel dataset to evaluate how international sanctions affect civilian economic and social well-being. Rather than relying solely on macroeconomic aggregates, the dataset integrates sanctions timing, trade transmission channels, household welfare indicators, and political controls. 

The objective of the data acquisition stage is to build a structured and reproducible panel framework capable of supporting fixed-effects and event-study analysis.


Data Source 1: Sanctions Data

Sanctions data are obtained from the Global Sanctions Data Base (GSDB), which provides structured information on sanction episodes, including:

- Target country
- Sender country
- Start and end dates
- Type of sanction (financial, trade, sectoral, targeted)
- Policy objectives

A sanction intensity index will be constructed using available episode-level information, incorporating:

- Duration of sanctions
- Sectoral coverage
- Financial restrictions
- Trade embargo scope

This dataset defines the treatment variable in the empirical framework.


Data Source 2: Trade Data (Transmission Mechanism)

Trade data are collected from the UN Comtrade database to capture how sanctions affect essential goods flows.

Key variables include:

- Food imports (HS codes 01–24)
- Pharmaceutical imports (HS code 30)
- Oil exports (HS code 27)
- Fuel imports

Trade variables are aggregated at the country-year level to measure contraction in essential goods flows. These variables serve as transmission channels linking sanctions to macroeconomic and welfare outcomes.


Data Source 3: Macroeconomic and Social Indicators

Macroeconomic and social indicators are obtained from the World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI).

Macroeconomic variables:
- GDP growth
- Inflation rate
- Unemployment rate

Household and welfare variables:
- Poverty rate
- Income inequality (Gini index)
- Under-5 child mortality
- School enrollment

These variables measure both aggregate economic performance and civilian well-being outcomes.


Data Source 4: Political and Conflict Controls

To strengthen causal identification, the dataset includes political and conflict variables.

Sources:
- UCDP Armed Conflict Dataset
- Polity V Dataset
- Archigos Political Leaders Dataset

Key variables include:
- Armed conflict incidence
- Conflict intensity
- Regime type
- Leadership turnover events

These variables allow the analysis to distinguish sanction-related effects from war-related shocks and to explore whether economic hardship coincides with political instability.


Data Construction and Integration

All datasets are harmonized into a country-year panel structure using standardized country codes and calendar years. Trade variables are aggregated from product-level data. Sanction intensity measures are constructed from episode-level characteristics.

The final dataset supports:
- Two-way fixed-effects panel regression
- Event-study designs
- Mediation analysis through trade channels
- Robustness checks controlling for conflict and regime characteristics


Data Accessibility and Reproducibility

All datasets used in this project are publicly available. Data acquisition, cleaning, aggregation, and merging are performed through documented Python scripts included in the repository.

The repository provides:

- Source documentation and download instructions
- Variable definitions and construction procedures
- Data cleaning and transformation scripts
- Reproducible panel dataset generation

This ensures full transparency, replicability, and methodological rigor appropriate for master’s-level research.
