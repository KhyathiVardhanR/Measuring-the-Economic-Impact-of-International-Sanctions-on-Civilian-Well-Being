Reflection and Next Steps – Milestone 1


Reflection

Milestone 1 established a structured and multidimensional foundation for analyzing the civilian impact of international sanctions. The research question was refined to move beyond simple macroeconomic indicators and incorporate trade flows, poverty, and social well-being measures.

The data acquisition process emphasized the importance of integrating multiple datasets, including sanctions severity measures, macroeconomic indicators, trade data, and household-level social indicators. This broadened approach strengthened the project’s ability to capture both national economic shocks and real civilian outcomes.

Building a relational SQLite database reinforced the value of careful schema design. Structuring the data as a country-year panel allows consistent alignment across sanctions, economic indicators, trade flows, and social variables. This organization supports future causal analysis and ensures scalability.

Initial exploratory analysis provided insight into cross-country variation, trade contraction patterns, inflation volatility, and data limitations such as missing values and inconsistent reporting. These findings highlighted the importance of distinguishing correlation from causation and confirmed the need for more rigorous econometric modeling in later stages.


Next Steps

In the next phase of the project, the analysis will move from descriptive exploration to formal statistical modeling. Planned steps include:

- Implementing Difference-in-Differences and event-study designs to evaluate sanction effects over time
- Testing lagged and dynamic impacts of sanctions on economic and social indicators
- Conducting subgroup analysis to assess heterogeneous effects across income levels and regions
- Refining sanction severity measures and comparing alternative specifications
- Addressing missing data through structured cleaning and validation procedures
- Evaluating robustness by controlling for confounding factors such as conflict or global economic shocks

The final stages of the project will focus on interpreting results carefully, acknowledging methodological limitations, and translating findings into policy-relevant insights regarding the civilian consequences of international sanctions.
