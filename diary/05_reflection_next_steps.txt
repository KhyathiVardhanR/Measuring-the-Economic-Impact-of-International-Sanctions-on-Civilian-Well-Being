Reflection and Next Steps – Milestone 1


Reflection

Milestone 1 established the theoretical and empirical foundation for analyzing international sanctions as instruments of economic coercion and evaluating their impact on civilian well-being.

The research framework was refined to move beyond isolated macroeconomic indicators and toward a structured treatment–mechanism–outcome model. By integrating sanctions data with trade flows, macroeconomic indicators, household welfare measures, and political/conflict controls, the project now captures both economic transmission channels and broader societal effects.

The data acquisition process emphasized harmonization across multiple sources and the construction of a unified country-year panel dataset. Incorporating trade variables strengthened the ability to test transmission mechanisms, while adding political and conflict controls improved the credibility of future causal inference.

The relational SQLite database reinforced the importance of structured schema design and reproducible workflows. Organizing the data into treatment, mechanism, outcome, and control tables ensures scalability and supports advanced econometric modeling.

Exploratory data analysis revealed substantial cross-country heterogeneity, dynamic patterns around sanction onset, and potential confounding from armed conflict. These findings underscore the importance of moving beyond descriptive correlation and adopting rigorous identification strategies in subsequent stages.


Next Steps

The next phase transitions from exploratory analysis to formal econometric evaluation.

Planned steps include:

- Implementing two-way fixed-effects panel regressions to estimate sanction effects
- Conducting event-study analysis to examine dynamic pre- and post-sanction trends
- Testing lag structures to capture delayed transmission effects
- Evaluating mediation through trade contraction channels
- Incorporating armed conflict and regime controls to mitigate confounding bias
- Performing subgroup analysis by income level, regime type, and sanction intensity
- Conducting robustness checks using alternative sanction severity specifications and balanced panel restrictions

An exploratory extension will examine whether prolonged economic hardship coincides with political instability or leadership turnover, while maintaining analytical neutrality.

The final stages of the project will focus on careful interpretation of results, explicit acknowledgment of identification limitations, and discussion of policy implications related to the humanitarian and political consequences of economic sanctions.
